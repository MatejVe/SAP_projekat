## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



```{r basic data analysis}
require(dplyr)

podaci = read.csv("Statistika nogometa≈°a engleske Premier lige.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

youngerThan25 = podaci[podaci["Age"] <= 25,]

teamAndMinutes = youngerThan25[c("Team","Min")]
teamAndMinutes$Min <- as.numeric(gsub(",","",teamAndMinutes$Min))

teamAndMinutes <- teamAndMinutes %>% mutate(Min = coalesce(Min, 0))

teamAndMinutes <- teamAndMinutes[!is.na(teamAndMinutes$Team),]

hist(teamAndMinutes$Min)

data_by_team <- teamAndMinutes %>% group_by(Team) %>% summarize(total_minutes=sum(Min))
```

Some words here

```{r barplot}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data_by_team, aes(x=Team, y=total_minutes)) + geom_bar()
```
